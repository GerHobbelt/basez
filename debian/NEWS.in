basez (_VERSION__DEB_DIST_ID_) stable; urgency=medium

  To avoid conflicts with certain debian packages the unhex, base32 and base64
  commands have been disabled by default.  A symlink to the basez executable
  would enable the missing command functionality. For example,

    ln -s /usr/bin/basez /usr/local/bin/unhex

  would provide the unhex command of the basez package.
